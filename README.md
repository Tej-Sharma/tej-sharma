## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

#### I am Tejas (tay-jus), and I like building in tech. 

Done a lot of both frontend and backend. React + TypeScript on the frontend, and Python / Node.js / Java / SQL on the backend. Also worked a lot with NoSQL databaes like MongoDB and Firebase as well as more traditional SQL solutions.
